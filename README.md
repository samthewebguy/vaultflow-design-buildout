# VaultFlow Landing Page (HTML/CSS/JS Practice)

This project is a **responsive landing page clone** of the **VaultFlow** design I discovered on Figma. I built it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a frontend development practice project, especially for those transitioning from Webflow to code-based workflows.

## Purpose

The goal was to improve my ability to translate modern Figma designs into functional web pages using semantic code and responsive design techniques.

## Features

- Pixel-accurate layout based on the Figma design
- Mobile-friendly
- Mobile navigation menu with JavaScript toggle
- Smooth visual styling with hover effects and clean layout

## Project Structure ðŸ“‚

- index.html - # Main HTML file
- style.css - # All custom styling
- script.js - # JavaScript for mobile menu functionality
- Images/ - # Folder for images, icons

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- JavaScript

## Notes

This project is built for learning and practice. I'm not affiliated with the actual VaultFlow brand.
